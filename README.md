Bash-Framework
==============

A framework for writing bash scripts. To use, simply put /lib in a directory, and source it in a scripts as follows:
. /path/to/lib/main.lib

For configuration, at the least, make sure to update the constant "LIBRARY_DIRECTORY" in main.lib to the full path of
wherever you put /lib.

Bash-Framework
==============

A framework for writing bash scripts. To use, simply put /lib in a directory, and source it in a scripts as follows:
. /path/to/lib/main.lib

Make sure that you use the full path in your scripts, or you may encounter problems. Also, make sure that you pass an
argument, or it may also cause issues. "all" "default" or names of modules to load are all acceptable.
